  - Added eventIndicator style to replace categoryIndicator

## Impact Summary

### ✅ Simplified User Experience
- Event creation form is now cleaner with fewer options
- Consistent event display without category colors
- Simpler event listing without category grouping
- No complex all-day vs timed event logic

### ✅ Code Simplification
- Removed 200+ lines of category/all-day related code
- Eliminated complex conditional rendering logic
- Reduced state management complexity
- Cleaner component interfaces

### ✅ Maintained Core Functionality
- ✅ Event creation and editing works
- ✅ Time-based event scheduling preserved
- ✅ Priority system (strict/non-strict) intact
- ✅ App blocking functionality unaffected
- ✅ Calendar display and navigation works
- ✅ Event storage and retrieval functional

## Technical Details
- **Total files modified**: 12 files
- **Build status**: ✅ Successful compilation
- **No breaking changes**: App runs without errors
- **Database compatibility**: Existing events still work (category/isAllDay fields ignored)

## User Workflow Changes

### Before (Complex)
1. Create event → Select category → Choose all-day toggle → Set times conditionally
2. View events → Grouped by category with color coding
3. Schedule display → Separate all-day section + hourly timeline

### After (Simplified)
1. Create event → Set title, time, and priority only
2. View events → Simple chronological list
3. Schedule display → Single hourly timeline

## Future Considerations
If categories or all-day events are needed again:
1. **Categories**: Could be re-implemented as simple tags/labels
2. **All-day events**: Could be re-added as a different scheduling approach
3. **Current data**: Existing events with category/isAllDay fields remain in storage but are ignored

The codebase is now cleaner, more maintainable, and focused on core calendar functionality with the priority-based app blocking feature.
