# Phase 5: App Blocking Integration - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## Overview
Phase 5 has been successfully implemented, providing seamless integration between calendar events and app blocking functionality. The system automatically monitors calendar events and blocks distracting apps during medium and high priority events.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. **Event-Based Auto Blocking** ‚úÖ
- **EventBlockingService**: Complete service bridging calendar events with AppBlocking
- **Automatic monitoring**: Checks calendar events every 30 seconds for active priority events
- **Smart timing**: Calculates remaining event duration and starts/stops blocking precisely
- **Background persistence**: Continues monitoring even when app is backgrounded

#### 2. **Settings Integration** ‚úÖ
- **AutoBlockingSettings Component**: Complete settings UI in SettingsScreen
- **Toggle control**: Enable/disable auto-blocking for priority events
- **Permission management**: Accessibility permission flow with user guidance
- **Status indicators**: Shows current monitoring and blocking status
- **Upcoming events preview**: Displays next 3 priority events that will trigger blocking

#### 3. **User Experience** ‚úÖ
- **BlockingStatusIndicator**: Visual status component showing current blocking state
  - Displays on HomeScreen (compact mode)
  - Displays on CalendarScreen (full mode)
  - Shows active blocking, monitoring, or inactive states
- **User notifications**: Alert notifications when auto-blocking starts/stops
- **Manual override**: Users can stop blocking manually with confirmation dialog

#### 4. **Background Processing** ‚úÖ
- **Foreground Service**: Android service maintains blocking even when app is closed
- **Accessibility Service**: Monitors app launches and closes blocked apps automatically
- **App state handling**: Proper handling of app backgrounding/foregrounding
- **Permission graceful handling**: Checks and prompts for accessibility permissions

### Technical Integration Points

#### 1. **CalendarContext Enhancement** ‚úÖ
- Integrated EventBlockingService with calendar state management
- Auto-starts monitoring when events are loaded and auto-blocking is enabled
- Provides blocking status to all components through context
- Handles manual override functionality

#### 2. **EventBlockingService** ‚úÖ
- **Event monitoring**: Tracks medium/high priority events with precise timing
- **Priority handling**: Supports switching to higher priority events
- **App state awareness**: Responds to app background/foreground transitions
- **Storage integration**: Persists auto-blocking preferences in AsyncStorage

#### 3. **Native Android Integration** ‚úÖ
- **AppBlocking.ts**: TypeScript interface for native module communication
- **AppBlockingModule.java**: Comprehensive native module with app discovery and blocking
- **BlockingForegroundService.java**: Background service with notification updates
- **AppBlockingAccessibilityService.java**: Accessibility service for real-time app blocking

### Success Criteria Achievement

‚úÖ **Event-based auto-blocking**: Automatically starts/stops for medium/high priority events  
‚úÖ **Settings integration**: Complete UI in SettingsScreen with app selection reuse  
‚úÖ **User experience**: Status indicators, notifications, and manual override capability  
‚úÖ **Background processing**: Works when app is backgrounded with proper permissions  

## üéØ Key User Flows

### 1. Enable Auto-Blocking
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Auto-Blocking
2. Grant accessibility permission if prompted
3. Toggle "Auto-block during priority events" ON
4. System automatically monitors calendar events

### 2. Automatic Blocking Experience
1. User creates medium/high priority calendar event
2. When event starts, auto-blocking activates with notification
3. Blocked apps automatically close when opened
4. When event ends, blocking stops with notification
5. All apps become accessible again

### 3. Manual Override
1. During active auto-blocking, user can see status indicator
2. Tap "Stop Blocking" or use manual override in settings
3. Blocking stops immediately with confirmation

## üõ†Ô∏è Recent Completions

1. **Added BlockingStatusIndicator to HomeScreen**: Now shows compact blocking status in top-right corner
2. **Enhanced CalendarContext**: Auto-starts event monitoring when events load and auto-blocking is enabled
3. **User feedback notifications**: Added Alert notifications when auto-blocking starts/stops
4. **Improved integration**: Seamless flow between calendar events and blocking system
