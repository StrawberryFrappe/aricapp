# Phase 5: App Blocking Integration - Final Update

## Summary
Completed the final updates to the Priority System Simplification and App Blocking Integration. The app now uses a clear "Strict" vs "Non-strict" priority system instead of the previous "High/Medium/Low" system.

## Changes Made in This Session

### 1. Updated useCalendar.js Hook
- **File**: `src/hooks/useCalendar.js`
- **Change**: Updated `sortByPriority` function to use new priority system
- **Before**: `{ high: 3, medium: 2, low: 1 }`
- **After**: `{ 'strict': 2, 'non-strict': 1 }`

### 2. Updated AutoBlockingSettings Priority Colors
- **File**: `src/screens/SettingsScreen/_components/AutoBlockingSettings.jsx`
- **Change**: Updated `getPriorityColor` function
- **Before**: `'high'` (red), `'medium'` (orange), `'low'` (gray)
- **After**: `'strict'` (red), `'non-strict'` (gray)

### 3. Updated EventCard Priority Colors
- **File**: `src/screens/CalendarScreen/_components/EventCard.jsx`
- **Change**: Updated `getPriorityColor` function
- **Before**: `'high'` (error), `'medium'` (warning), `'low'` (success)
- **After**: `'strict'` (error), `'non-strict'` (textSecondary)

### 4. Updated CompactEvent Component
- **File**: `src/components/CompactEvent.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `getPriorityColor` function to use new priority system
  - Updated priority text display from "{priority} priority" to user-friendly text:
    - `'strict'` → "Apps blocked"
    - `'non-strict'` → "Apps allowed"

## Complete Implementation Status

### ✅ Core Features Implemented
1. **Event-based App Blocking**: Automatically blocks apps during "strict" priority events
2. **Manual Override System**: Users can disable blocking for current events, which marks them as "non-strict" to prevent reactivation
3. **Priority System**: Simplified to "Strict" (blocks apps) and "Non-strict" (allows apps)
4. **User Interface**: Clean UI with clear language about app blocking behavior
5. **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback showing blocking status throughout the app
6. **Native Integration**: Android service for app blocking functionality

### ✅ User Experience Features
1. **Auto-monitoring**: Automatically starts monitoring when events are loaded and auto-blocking is enabled
2. **Notifications**: Alert dialogs when auto-blocking starts/stops
3. **Settings Panel**: Easy enable/disable of auto-blocking with preview of upcoming strict events
4. **Event Creation**: Clear choice between "Block Apps" and "Allow Apps" with helpful hints
5. **Visual Feedback**: Priority indicators and blocking status throughout the UI

### ✅ Technical Implementation
1. **EventBlockingService**: Comprehensive service handling blocking logic, manual overrides, and cleanup
2. **CalendarContext**: Integration with calendar events and monitoring lifecycle
3. **Native Android Service**: Background service for actual app blocking functionality
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and fallback behaviors
5. **State Management**: Consistent state management across components

## System Architecture

```
CalendarContext
    ↓ (provides events and auto-blocking state)
EventBlockingService
    ↓ (monitors strict events)
Native Android Service
    ↓ (performs actual app blocking)
UI Components
    ↓ (display status and controls)
User
```

## Testing Scenarios Covered

1. **Basic Flow**: Create strict event → Auto-blocking activates → Apps are blocked
2. **Manual Override**: Disable blocking during event → Event becomes non-strict → No reactivation
3. **Event Transitions**: Multiple events → Proper activation/deactivation
4. **Settings Management**: Enable/disable auto-blocking → Proper monitoring start/stop
5. **Visual Feedback**: All UI components show correct priority and blocking status

## Files Modified

### Core Logic
- `src/models/CalendarModels.js` - Event model with strict/non-strict priority
- `src/services/EventBlockingService.js` - Main blocking service logic
- `src/context/CalendarContext.jsx` - Integration with calendar events

### UI Components
- `src/components/CreateEvent.jsx` - Event creation with priority selection
- `src/components/CompactEvent.jsx` - Priority display in compact events
- `src/components/BlockingStatusIndicator.jsx` - Status indicator component
- `src/screens/SettingsScreen/_components/AutoBlockingSettings.jsx` - Settings panel
- `src/screens/CalendarScreen/_components/EventCard.jsx` - Priority colors in event cards
- `src/screens/HomeScreen/HomeScreen.jsx` - Added status indicator

### Utilities
- `src/hooks/useCalendar.js` - Updated priority sorting

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Advanced Scheduling**: Support for recurring events with different blocking patterns
2. **App Categories**: Block specific categories of apps instead of all apps
3. **Gradual Blocking**: Warning periods before full blocking activates
4. **Analytics**: Track blocking effectiveness and user compliance
5. **Cross-platform**: iOS implementation of app blocking

## User Guide

### Creating Events with App Blocking
1. Tap "+" to create a new event
2. Choose "Block Apps" for focus sessions or "Allow Apps" for regular events
3. The hint text explains the blocking behavior

### Managing Auto-blocking
1. Go to Settings → Auto-blocking
2. Toggle "Auto-block during priority events"
3. View upcoming strict events that will trigger blocking

### Handling Active Blocking
1. When blocking is active, a red indicator shows "Apps Blocked"
2. Tap the indicator to manually disable blocking for the current event
3. The event becomes "non-strict" and won't reactivate blocking

The implementation is now complete and ready for production use!
