## Implementation Notes

### Performance Targets
- Calendar month render: < 100ms
- Event list load: < 50ms for 30 events
- Storage operations: < 200ms
- Memory usage: < 50MB for 1000 events

### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript definitions for models
- JSDoc comments for utilities
- Component prop validation
- Consistent error handling
- Theme system compliance

### Future Considerations
- Cloud sync capability (post-MVP)
- External calendar import
- Advanced recurring patterns
- Multi-calendar support
- Event sharing features

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **AsyncStorage Limits**: Implement data pagination and cleanup
2. **Performance on Old Devices**: Progressive loading and optimization
3. **Date/Time Complexity**: Use battle-tested date-fns library
4. **State Management**: Careful context optimization

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular performance profiling
- Incremental feature rollout
- Comprehensive error boundaries
- Graceful degradation for features
